-In this project, a dashboard was designed using Microsoft PowerBI with the dataset titled "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023" obtained from Kaggle. I created an interactive and insightful dashboard to visualize the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023. The goal is to provide a clear and engaging way to explore the data and gain insights into streaming trends. I would like to thank Injae Park for the free tutorial. Sources Below.
